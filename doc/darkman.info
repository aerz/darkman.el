1 Installation
**************

     In an effort to keep the instructions concise, portable and
     applicable no matter the situation, this section will not list
     every possible method through which you can install the package,
     only the most basic.

   Begin by cloning the repository:

     git clone --branch 0.4.0 https://github.com/grtcdr/darkman.el darkman

   Next, add the package to your load path
(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Lisp-Libraries.html):

     (add-to-list 'load-path "darkman")

   Finally, require the package like so:

     (require 'darkman)

2 Usage
*******

In your ‘init.el’ file, define which theme is associated with which
mode.  By default, _modus-themes_ will be used, but we’ll choose the
_tango_ variants in this example.

     (setq darkman-themes '(:light tango :dark tango-dark))

   You can also use ‘M-x customize-group darkman RET’ to customize the
variable.

   ‘darkman.el’ can listen for any signals to change the theme without
requiring you to manually create any scripts.  You can enable this
behavior by enabling the minor mode:

     (darkman-mode)

   You should not call ‘load-theme’ in your configuration as
‘darkman-mode’ when enabled will do that for you, even on startup.

2.1 Other functions
===================

‘M-x darkman-toggle’ will toggle the mode of the Darkman service from
within Emacs.

   Additionally, you can use the ‘darkman-get’ and ‘darkman-set’
functions to manually get and set the mode of the service respectively.

File: darkman.info,  Node: Working alongside the built-in safety features,  Next: Disabling existing themes,  Up: Tips

3.1 Working alongside the built-in safety features
==================================================

‘load-theme’ is part of the ‘custom.el’ library and it comes with
certain security features
(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Custom-Themes.html)
that you may regard as inconvenient, but they’re absolutely necessary to
preserve the security of your system.  We have decided to work hand in
hand with these pre-existing safety mechanisms in favor of implementing
our own.

   Problems will arise if this package is loaded too early during the
initialization phase, i.e.  before ‘custom-file’, you can prevent this
from happening
(https://github.com/grtcdr/darkman.el/pull/7#issuecomment-1422666665) by
activating the mode only when the session has been fully initialized.


File: darkman.info,  Node: Disabling existing themes,  Prev: Working alongside the built-in safety features,  Up: Tips

3.2 Disabling existing themes
=============================

Emacs does not by default disable the current theme when another one is
loaded, and while this behavior might seem unintuitive, we can always
advise ‘darkman-set’ (and by extension ‘darkman-toggle’), or even
‘load-theme’ if you prefer, to disable any existing themes first.

     (defadvice darkman-set (before no-theme-stacking activate)
       "Disable the previous theme before loading a new one."
       (mapc #'disable-theme custom-enabled-themes))

4.1 Is D-Bus running?
=====================

Use your service manager to verify whether the service is running,
here’s an example using ‘systemd’:

     systemctl status dbus

     ● dbus.service - D-Bus System Message Bus
          Loaded: loaded
          Active: active (running)

4.2 Is Darkman running?
=======================

Use your service manager to verify whether the service is running,
here’s an example using ‘systemd’:

     systemctl status --user darkman

     ● darkman.service - Framework for dark-mode and light-mode transitions.
          Loaded: loaded
          Active: active (running)

4.3 Is Emacs built with D-Bus support?
======================================

Usually it is, unless you’re building from source, in which case you can
verify whether or not Emacs was built with D-Bus support using ‘C-h v
system-configuration-features RET’ which should list ‘DBUS’.
